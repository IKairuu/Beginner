Description: I am a beginner in programming but I've got plenty of projects programmed
but not posted on github(EX:Online Bookstore System, Library Management System, 
Hangman's Game) these are my beginner projects. Now I tried to apply C++ in game 
developing and this is the output of my program by using <graphics.h>, this is not
a common library on an ide and you have to configure first your ide and install 
graphics.h. I will include here the links for configuring <graphics.h> in its 
respective IDEs: 

Visual Studio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0_vt-7Ok6U
Code::Blocks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEkAj-xVTKQ
DevC++: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHFyEnlMnxg 
(I always use DevC++)

Reminders:
Copyright Purposes
Music Link of the game: https://soundcloud.com/dog-tier/megalovania-hard-mode
1.This is a pacman game with different rules, pacman must not hit the wall or hit
the obstacles within the game.
2.I will remove the background music of the game due to copyright purposes but you can
find the background music on my provided link above.
3.I apologize for my construction of code due to buffering purposes, I used
setactivepage and setvisualpage to remove the flickering display of the game.
4.I will improve this code in the future by appling OOP programing since our professor
restricted us from OOP programming and just use the built-in functions of the program.
5.To activate the audio system of the program open the project options and select 
parameters you will see the linker command line and input -lwinmm, moreover, go to
the compiler tab select code generation and set language standard as GNU C++11(in 
DevC++, I dont know in different IDE).
5.As of now I am studying SFML to make use of the sprites and it is more easy to 
develop games with SFML than graphics.h however graphics.h may improve your skills 
logically as well(Based on my exerience).
